# Machine Learning
The repository contains the following projects:

## Project 1: A Gambling simulator
Implementing a betting strategy to the gambling game "Roulette". Running experiments on that model to understand winning probabilities and plotting the results using Python.

## Project 2: Optimizing a Portfolio
Implementing an optimizer to optimize specific metric of a portfolio, and thereby computing optimal allocations of stocks that maximize the portfolio's performance using Python.

## Project 3: Assessing Learners
Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Learner, Random Tree Learner and Bootstrap Aggregating Learner for Regression problems.
Running experiments to evaluate and compare the learners in terms of performance metrics, overfitting, etc.

## Project 4: Defeat Learners
Generating appropriate datasets to compare different learners. Understanding how to choose a machine learning algorithm for different kinds of datasets.

## Project 5: Market Simulator
Implementing a market simulator using Python that accepts trade orders and generates portfolio values. Assess and plot various performance metrics of the portfolio over time.

## Project 6: Manual Strategy 
Developing a trading strategy using various Technical indicators and test the model against the stock market simulator. Perform data visualization and comparative analysis of different strategies.

## Project 7: Q Learning Robot (Reinforcement Learning Problem)
Implementing a Q Learner and then a Dyna Q to solve a navigation problem. Assessing the policy and fine tuning the model to improve performance.

## Project 8: Machine Learning Vs Manual Strategy for a trading problem
Implementing a machine learning strategy using a Random Forest Learner and comparing the results against the manual strategy. Evaluate the results and fine tune the machine learning model for better performance.
Frame the trading problem into a classification problem for the machine learner.
